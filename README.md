# virtual_datasystem
Here, I built a virtual datasystem using INodes as basic data structures. This was a university project I had a lot of fun with, but I also faced some tough challenges, because this was my first big project using C. However, this was also the reason why I learned a lot about programming with C and now can confidently program with C.
